# 🧠 AI-Powered Technical Interviewer.

This project is an AI-powered technical interviewer that conducts multi-stage interviews, scores candidate answers on clarity, accuracy, and depth, and provides intelligent feedback — all running locally using LangChain and Ollama.

✅ API Usage
POST /docs
Request Body:
{
  "session_id": "aiman_session1",
  "topic": "Python",
  "stage": 0,
  "user_response": ""
}
The stage should be incremented per question (0–5).
user_response is empty on first question and filled afterward.

🧩 Example Q&A Flow
User sends request with stage: 0 → receives Q1.
User submits answer with stage: 1 → gets feedback + Q2.
After stage 5 → receives total average scores and summary.


🧠 Design Decisions
Local Execution: Powered by Ollama and LLaMA3 for full offline capability.
Plain Feedback Parsing: Uses regex to extract scores, allowing flexibility.
Follow-up Prompts: Automatically generated when scores fall below 6.
Evaluation Robustness: Falls back to default scoring if feedback parsing fails.


➕ Optional Features Implemented
 Score Breakdown: Clarity, Accuracy, Depth (out of 10)
 Average Score Summary after 5 questions
